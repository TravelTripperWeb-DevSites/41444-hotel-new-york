Even after the waiter vouched for me and remembered me it took 3 different male managers to ask me what “the situation was”.  I  want to point out that even the waiter was shocked with the managements treatment towards me. The rooms division manager Eliot foster was extremely rude to me when resolving this. The whole thing felt very racist and it was embarrassing and awful. Never want to go back there ever again.",

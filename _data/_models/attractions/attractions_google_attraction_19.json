It was in an incredible location with great views, fantastic food and lovely people who are always happy to help. The person at the front desk helped us with our bags and went out of her way to make sure we were pleased. The only thing that was disappointed is we asked for a trundle bed to be put out whilst we were out for a couple hours, but when we got back they werenâ€™t there and we had to call. Other then that, a great stay.",

At check-in a fella named Isaac was extremely kind! He made sure that we were comfortable with our room being on the highest floor due to some people not being fond of heights. Explained where everything we needed in the hotel was thoroughly. Going that extra mile really made me feel welcomed and comfortable. \n\nThe room was beautiful and very clean, I didnâ€™t have anything to complain about considering that Iâ€™ve traveled a lot and stayed in a few hotels when traveling this is my top 5 favorite! \n\nThe food at breakfast was amazing! During check out we also had a lovely encounter with a wonderful woman by the name of Victoria! She also made sure we enjoyed our stay and made great conversation. Itâ€™s all about a warm welcome and a fond farewell they provided just that. \n\nThank you again so much for being so accommodating!",

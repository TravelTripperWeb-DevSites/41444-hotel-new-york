Room was clean, bed was a king size. The room was small, but that's what you gotta deal with in NYC. AC was strong and worked 100%, bathroom was clean, shower was good. No complaints here.

I have never stayed in a hotel as nice and aesthetically pleasing as this. We stayed in a \"Deluxe King\" room - it was decently sized. The TV *IN* the mirror was super fascinating (yes I said in - it was actually disguised when it was turned off), as well as the all glass dresser that you could hang your clothes in. The lights in the bathroom we're top notch to do your make up in, as well as the rainfall shower head. I felt top notch getting ready to go out in the city in this room. It is perfectly placed very close to Times Square - you walk out of the hotel and it's about less than a 3 minute walk to the heart of Times Square. The location is right next to the theater that plays \"the Book of Mormon\" - which was convenient because that was the only show we went to see during our stay. If we were to plan another stay near Times Square - this would be where we would go again. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",

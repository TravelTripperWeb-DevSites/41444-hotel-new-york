I will break down my experience What I liked: they opened a Mexican restaurant down below the skyline hotel and the food was really good. I really enjoyed the quality an do the variety of food they had to offer. The room temperature, service, AC, heater, and overall service was good. The concierge was nice and have us a lot of good tips and tricks. What I didn't like: the wifi was not free so we had to pay for it. It was 10 bucks a day which was quite expensive. Additionally, if you wanted water it I've, you had to go all the way down to the restaurant. They did not have today services on the floor.",

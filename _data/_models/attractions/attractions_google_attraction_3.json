I was able to pay cash for my stay other than my security deposit, which was $100 for one night. The rooms are old but they have recently been updated a little from the last time I stayed there. They no longer have the old, ugly comforters that some hotels still have and were replaced with clean white sheets. The room was large and decently priced because of the location we had. You could tell they had just vacuumed, which was nice! We ended up self-parking in a garage nearby but valet was available as well (Icon Parking). If you self-park, make sure to get your ticket stamped at the front desk for the discount to park there. The parking garage has people park your car for you and then they bring it up to you when you turn in your ticket and pay (which is really nice). For long-term stays, I would recommend staying elsewhere but if you're just needing a place to sleep, I definitely recommend it!",

Breakfast was practically a line where you pick up ONE FOOD ITEM and ONE DRINK (before you descend to the nuclear shelter) and staff are rude. The ROOMS HAVE MICE. All of them, even after they moved me up to the 12th floor I managed to find a mouse there too. Pillows were dirty and left me with an eye infection (side I sleep on).

We came with a member in a wheelchair, and the staff was very accommodating.  Both our rooms (one with wheelchair access, one without) had plenty of space and were neatly cleaned before and during our trip.  The small cafe in the lobby was very convenient for small breakfasts and had plenty to choose from.  We had no issues with the staff or other guests, and really enjoyed our stay.",

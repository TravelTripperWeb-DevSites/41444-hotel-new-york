We had our 18 month old with us and there was also a crib in the room for us when we arrived. Breakfast was complimentary and included a nice spread of pastries, fruits, cereal, bagels, coffee, juice, and tea. Every afternoon there is complimentary wine and cheese which also includes fruit and veggies along with other snacks. Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The location is perfect for being able to easily explore many main tourist attractions. Everything was clean and the room was surprisingly big for a Manhattan hotel. We had a difficult time finding a hotel in the city that offered a single king bed but found it here. We will definitely stay at The Pearl again.",

After learning what had happened to us earlier in the night, they made sure that I enjoy my stay at The Pearl.\n\nThe deluxe queen room was tidy, clean and tastefully decorated. Bathroom was clean and equipped with all the necessities. A small TV was mounted for your viewing pleasure. The spacious balcony was an added bonus!\n\nAli and Ignacio explained everything in detail and never once did they seem to be bothered or showed any signs of impatience. In addition to a wonderful boutique hotel, the staff elevated the experience at The Pearl. \n\nBravo The Pearl! I will undoubtedly stay again next time I'm in NYC.",

That worked great so our two teens didn’t have to share a bed!  The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom is very nice and roomy!
